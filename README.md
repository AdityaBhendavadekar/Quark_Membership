## 1. Identifiers, Literals, and Variables

**Question 1:**  
Write a program that declares variables for storing the following information:  
- A student's name (String)  
- Their age (int)  
- Their height in meters (double)  
- Whether they are enrolled in the course (boolean)  

Print all these values in a formatted way.

**Question 2:**  
What is wrong with the following variable declarations? Fix them.  
```java
int 1stNumber = 10;
String user-name = "John";
float percentage% = 98.5f;
```

---

## 2. Operators

**Question 3:**  
Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations:  
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  
- Modulus  

Print the results for each operation.

**Question 4:**  
Write a program to check whether a given number is divisible by both 5 and 7. Use logical operators (`&&` or `||`) to solve this.

---

## 3. If-Else Constructs

**Question 5:**  
Write a program that takes a number as input and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else` statements.

**Question 6:**  
Write a program that takes three numbers as input and determines the largest among them using nested `if-else` statements.

**Question 7:**  
Write a program that takes a character as input and checks whether it is a vowel or a consonant.

---

## 4. Looping Paradigms

**Question 8:**  
Write a program to print the first 10 natural numbers using:  
- A `for` loop  
- A `while` loop  
- A `do-while` loop  

**Question 9:**  
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user using a `for` loop.

**Question 10:**  
Write a program to print the following pattern using nested loops:  
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

**Question 11:**  
Write a program to find all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using loops.

---

## 5. Strings

**Question 12:**  
Write a program that takes a string as input and prints its length, the first character, and the last character.

**Question 13:**  
Write a program to reverse a string entered by the user without using any built-in functions.

**Question 14:**  
Write a program to check whether a given string is a palindrome (e.g., "madam" or "racecar").

---

## 6. Arrays

**Question 15:**  
Write a program to initialize an array of integers and find the sum of all elements.

**Question 16:**  
Write a program to find the largest and smallest element in an array of integers.

**Question 17:**  
Write a program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using any sorting technique (e.g., Bubble Sort).

**Question 18:**  
Write a program to take two arrays of integers as input and merge them into a third array. Print the merged array.

---

## 7. Command Line Arguments

**Question 19:**  
Write a program that takes two numbers as command-line arguments and prints their sum.

**Question 20:**  
Write a program that takes a string as a command-line argument and prints whether it is a palindrome.

---

## 8. Switch-Case

**Question 1:**  
Write a program that takes a number (1 to 7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week using a `switch-case` statement. For example:  
- Input: `1` â†’ Output: "Monday"  
- Input: `7` â†’ Output: "Sunday"  
If the input is outside the range 1â€“7, print "Invalid input."

**Question 2:**  
Write a menu-driven program that performs basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) based on user input. Use a `switch-case` statement to handle the logic.

**Question 3:**  
Write a program that takes a student's grade (A, B, C, D, or F) as input and prints a corresponding message using a `switch-case` statement.

**Question 4:**  
Write a program that takes a single character as input and checks whether it is a vowel or a consonant using a `switch-case` statement.

---

## 9. Mixed Questions

**Question 21:**  
Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and prints all the even numbers in the array using a `for-each` loop.

**Question 22:**  
Write a program to simulate a simple calculator. The program should:  
- Take two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input.  
- Perform the corresponding operation using `if-else` or `switch-case`.  
- Handle division by zero errors.

**Question 23:**  
Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number using a `while` loop.

**Question 24:**  
Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string entered by the user.

**Question 25:**  
Write a program to find the second largest element in an array of integers.

---

## Challenging Questions

**Question 26:**  
Write a program to implement a basic login system. The program should:  
- Store a username and password as hardcoded values.  
- Ask the user to enter their username and password.  
- Allow three attempts to log in. If the user fails after three attempts, print "Account locked."

**Question 27:**  
Write a program to simulate a dice roll game. The program should:  
- Generate a random number between 1 and 6.  
- Ask the user to guess the number.  
- Provide feedback on whether the guess was correct or not.

**Question 28:**  
Write a program to find all pairs of integers in an array whose sum equals a given number.
