### Practice Questions

#### 1. Functions
1. Write a function `isPrime(int num)` that checks if a number is prime and returns `true` or `false`.
2. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
3. Create a function `findMax(int[] arr)` that returns the maximum value in an array.

#### 2. Classes and Objects
1. Create a `Student` class with attributes `name`, `rollNumber`, and `marks`. Add methods to:
   - Calculate the average marks.
   - Display student details.
2. Design a `BankAccount` class with attributes `accountNumber`, `balance`, and methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `displayBalance()`.
3. Create a `Book` class with a static variable `totalBooks` to track the number of books created.

#### 3. Inheritance
1. Create a base class `Vehicle` with attributes `speed` and `fuelType`. Derive two classes `Car` and `Motorcycle` that override a method `displayDetails()`.
2. Implement a `Shape` class with a method `calculateArea()`. Derive classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` to override this method.
3. Design a `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`. Derive `Employee` and `Student` classes with additional attributes like `salary` and `grade`.

#### 4. Access Modifiers
1. Create a class `Employee` with private attributes `id` and `salary`. Provide public getter and setter methods.
2. Design a class `Animal` with a protected attribute `species`. Derive a class `Dog` and access the `species` attribute.
3. Demonstrate the difference between `public`, `private`, and `default` access by creating classes in the same and different packages.

#### 5. Exception Handling
1. Write a program to handle `ArithmeticException` (division by zero) using `try-catch`.
2. Create a custom exception `InvalidAgeException` and throw it if a user enters an age less than 18.
3. Write a program to read data from a file and handle `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`.

#### 6. ArrayList
1. Write a program to add 5 student names to an `ArrayList` and display them using a loop.
2. Create an `ArrayList` of integers. Remove all even numbers from the list.
3. Write a program to search for a specific element in an `ArrayList` and print its index.
4. Sort an `ArrayList` of strings in alphabetical order.
