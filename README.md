## Week 1: Basics of Java

### Topics Covered
1. **Identifiers, Literals, and Variables**
   - Understanding identifiers, literals, and variables.
   - Data types in Java (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
2. **If-Else Constructs**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `nested if-else`).
3. **Loop Constructs**
   - Looping paradigms (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, `for-each`).
4. **Switch-Case**
   - Using `switch-case` for decision-making.

### Practice Questions

#### 1. Identifiers, Literals, and Variables
1. Write a program to declare variables of different data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) and print their values.
2. Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
3. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given the radius.

#### 2. If-Else Constructs
1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested `if-else`.
3. Write a program to determine the grade of a student based on their marks (A, B, C, D, F).

#### 3. Loop Constructs
1. Write a program to print the first 10 natural numbers using a `for` loop.
2. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.
3. Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to a given number.

#### 4. Switch-Case
1. Write a program that takes a number (1-7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week.
2. Write a program to perform basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) using a `switch-case` statement.
3. Write a program to check if a given character is a vowel or consonant using a `switch-case`.

   - Arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators.
2. **Strings**
   - String manipulation, methods, and operations.
3. **Arrays**
   - Declaring, initializing, and manipulating arrays.
4. **Command Line Arguments**
   - Using command-line arguments in Java programs.

### Practice Questions

#### 1. Operators
1. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).
2. Create a program to calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers.
3. Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.

#### 2. Strings
1. Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
2. Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome.
3. Write a program to reverse a string without using built-in functions.

#### 3. Arrays
1. Write a program to find the largest and smallest element in an array.
2. Write a program to reverse an array without using an extra array.
3. Write a program to sort an array in ascending order.

#### 4. Command Line Arguments
1. Write a program that takes two numbers as command-line arguments and prints their sum.
2. Write a program that takes a string as a command-line argument and checks if it is a palindrome.


## Week 3: Object-Oriented Programming

### Topics Covered
1. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling methods.
   - Method parameters and return types.
2. **Classes and Objects**
   - Creating classes, objects, and constructors.
   - Instance vs. static members.
3. **Inheritance**
   - Single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
   - Method overriding and `super` keyword.
4. **Access Modifiers**
   - `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default access.

### Practice Questions

#### 1. Functions
1. Write a function `isPrime(int num)` that checks if a number is prime and returns `true` or `false`.
2. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
3. Create a function `findMax(int[] arr)` that returns the maximum value in an array.

#### 2. Classes and Objects
1. Create a `Student` class with attributes `name`, `rollNumber`, and `marks`. Add methods to:
   - Calculate the average marks.
   - Display student details.
2. Design a `BankAccount` class with attributes `accountNumber`, `balance`, and methods `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `displayBalance()`.
3. Create a `Book` class with a static variable `totalBooks` to track the number of books created.

#### 3. Inheritance
1. Create a base class `Vehicle` with attributes `speed` and `fuelType`. Derive two classes `Car` and `Motorcycle` that override a method `displayDetails()`.
2. Implement a `Shape` class with a method `calculateArea()`. Derive classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` to override this method.
3. Design a `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`. Derive `Employee` and `Student` classes with additional attributes like `salary` and `grade`.

#### 4. Access Modifiers
1. Create a class `Employee` with private attributes `id` and `salary`. Provide public getter and setter methods.
2. Design a class `Animal` with a protected attribute `species`. Derive a class `Dog` and access the `species` attribute.
3. Demonstrate the difference between `public`, `private`, and `default` access by creating classes in the same and different packages.

## Mixed Questions

### Description
This section contains questions that combine concepts from multiple topics.

---

### Practice Questions
1. Write a program to find the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
2. Write a program to count the frequency of each element in an array.
3. Write a program to print the following pattern using loops:
   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ```
4. Write a program to find the second largest number in an array.
5. Write a program to check if a given string is an anagram of another string.
6. **Library System**: Create a `Library` class with a list of `Book` objects (use the `Book` class from Week 3). Add methods to:
   - Add a book.
   - Search for a book by title.
   - Display all books (use inheritance for different book types like `Fiction` and `NonFiction`).
7. **Complex Numbers**: Design a `Complex` class to represent complex numbers. Overload the `+` and `*` operators to add and multiply complex numbers.
8. **Employee Hierarchy**: Create a `Manager` class (inheriting from `Employee`) with a `department` attribute. Override the `displayDetails()` method to include department information.
